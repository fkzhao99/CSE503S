# How to use
You need to start node server and visit http://localhost:3456/client.html to use our website. (You need to add 'client/html')  
For myself, the url is http://127.0.0.1:3456/client.html.

- First of all, you need to log in with an arbitrary name.
- After logging in, you will see all the chat rooms on the left part of the page. You can join a room by just clicking it.
- You can create a room and protect it with a password (optional).
- After joining a room, you will see all the users in the room on the mid part of the page. You can kick or ban a user if you are the creator of the room.
- You can see the chat logs and send messages on the right part of the page. You can send private messages by modifying the value in the drop-down box.

# Creative Portion
- You will not lose the chat logs when you leave a room. (Unless the server is shut down)
- The messages sent by yourself are displayed on the right, while others' are on the left.
- When a user joins/leaves or is kicked/banned out of a room, other users in the room will be informed by a notice in the chat log panel.
- Inappropriate messages will be filtered. (F-Word, N-Word, S-Word, B-Word)
