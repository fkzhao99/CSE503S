## How to use

- We have created 3 users:
  - Username: bob   Password: 1  (we have already added some events in 3/22/2022 in bob account)
  - Username: andy   Password: 2
  - Username: peter   Password: 3
- As a guest, you can view the calendar but can not see events.
- You can register and login at the top of the calendar. 
- After login, you can see your events of a certain day in the middle of the page by clicking this day on the calendar. You can click a certain event for its detailed information. You can edit, delete and share this event on the panel. By clicking the 'share' button, there will be an alert message that contains the code of this event. Other users who have this code can use this code to get this event in the 'New Event' panel.
- You can also add new events in the right part of the page. You can change the date of the new event by clicking the date of the calendar. You can add group event by clicking the 'group' checkbox and selecting other users you want to post group events.
- All the events are divided into 5 categories. You can show a certain category by selecting category in the dropdown box on the middle of this page.

## Creative Portion

- Users can tag an event with a particular category and enable/disable those tags in the calendar view.
- Users can share their calendar with additional users. 
- Users can create group events that display on multiple users calendars.
